# Next.js Demo for BackdropEngine

This example demonstrates how to integrate the core logic of the BackdropEngine into a Next.js (TypeScript) application.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.**

## Features
- Uses the core logic from the main package
- SSR-safe (browser-only code in `useEffect`)
- Minimal UI for webcam and background switching

## Notes
- This is a minimal demo. For production, follow best practices for security and performance.
- See the main repo README for more details on the core logic and API.
