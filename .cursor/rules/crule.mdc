# Cursor Rules for BackdropEngine

##Rules
- Use TypeScript for all source files.
- All browser-only code must be inside useEffect or equivalent (for SSR safety).
- Expose only UI-agnostic hooks and utilities from the core package.
- Write unit tests for all core logic and compositing functions.
- Document all public APIs and options in the main README.
- Use Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and linting.
